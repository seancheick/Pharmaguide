# Application Architecture

## Overview
Pharmaguide is a React Native application built with TypeScript, using Expo for cross-platform development. The app focuses on supplement safety, interaction checking, and health profile management with HIPAA compliance.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Components:** Reusable UI components organized by feature
- **Screens:** Screen-specific components for each app route
- **Navigation:** React Navigation setup with state persistence

#### Component Organization
```
src/components/
├── common/          # Reusable components (Button, Input, etc.)
├── auth/           # Authentication components
├── home/           # Home screen components
├── scan/           # Product scanning components
├── search/         # Search functionality components
├── stack/          # User supplement stack components
├── profile/        # Health profile components
├── compliance/     # FDA compliance components
└── accessibility/  # Accessibility-focused components
```

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- **Hooks:** Custom React hooks for business logic and state management
- **Services:** External service integrations and API calls
- **Utils:** Utility functions and helpers

#### Key Services
```
src/services/
├── ai/             # AI analysis services (HuggingFace, Groq)
├── database/       # Supabase database operations
├── storage/        # Local and cloud storage management
├── navigation/     # Navigation state management
├── performance/    # Performance monitoring and optimization
├── health/         # Health profile management (HIPAA-compliant)
└── interactions/   # Supplement interaction checking
```

### 3. Data Layer
- **Storage:** Unified storage system with local and cloud tiers
- **API:** External API integrations (Supabase, HuggingFace, Groq)
- **Database:** Supabase database operations with proper typing

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. HIPAA Compliance
- **Local-Only Health Data:** All health profile data is stored locally with AES-256 encryption
- **No PHI in Cloud:** Health data never leaves the device
- **Secure Storage:** Uses React Native's secure storage for sensitive data

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Memory Management:** Comprehensive memory leak detection and prevention
- **Bundle Optimization:** Code splitting and lazy loading for heavy modules
- **Image Optimization:** Caching and optimization for product images
- **Network Caching:** Intelligent caching for API responses

### 3. State Management
- **Unified Storage:** Single storage interface with tiered storage (SECURE, LOCAL, CLOUD)
- **Navigation State:** Persistent navigation state with recovery mechanisms
- **Form Persistence:** Automatic form data persistence with validation

### 4. Error Handling
- **Error Boundaries:** React error boundaries for component-level error handling
- **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback mechanisms for failed API calls
- **User Feedback:** Toast notifications and error screens for user communication

## Data Flow

### 1. Product Scanning Flow
```
User Scan → Barcode/OCR → Product Lookup → AI Analysis → Interaction Check → Results Display
```

### 2. Health Profile Flow
```
Setup → Local Storage → Validation → Profile Management → Local Updates
```

### 3. Supplement Stack Flow
```
Add Item → Validation → Database Storage → Points Award → Stack Update
```

## Security Architecture

### 1. Data Protection
- **Encryption:** AES-256 for local health data
- **Secure Storage:** React Native secure storage for sensitive data
- **No PHI Transmission:** Health data never sent to cloud services

### 2. API Security
- **Supabase Auth:** Secure authentication with JWT tokens
- **API Keys:** Environment-based API key management
- **Rate Limiting:** Request deduplication and rate limiting

### 3. Input Validation
- **Sanitization:** All user inputs are sanitized
- **Validation:** Comprehensive validation rules for forms
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript for compile-time type checking

## Performance Architecture

### 1. Memory Management
- **Leak Detection:** Automatic memory leak detection and reporting
- **Resource Tracking:** Tracking of timers, listeners, and subscriptions
- **Auto Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup of unused resources

### 2. Bundle Optimization
- **Code Splitting:** Dynamic imports for heavy modules
- **Lazy Loading:** Lazy loading of non-critical components
- **Tree Shaking:** Removal of unused code

### 3. Network Optimization
- **Request Deduplication:** Prevents duplicate API calls
- **Caching:** Intelligent caching of API responses
- **Offline Support:** Offline mode with local data

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Component Tests:** React Testing Library for component testing
- **Hook Tests:** Custom hook testing with proper cleanup
- **Service Tests:** Service layer testing with mocked dependencies

### 2. Integration Tests
- **API Integration:** End-to-end API testing
- **Navigation Flow:** Complete user journey testing
- **Storage Integration:** Storage system testing

### 3. Performance Tests
- **Memory Leak Tests:** Automated memory leak detection
- **Bundle Size Tests:** Bundle size monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time performance metrics

## Development Workflow

### 1. Code Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure:** Components organized by feature
- **Consistent Naming:** ESLint rules for naming conventions
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript configuration

### 2. Quality Assurance
- **Linting:** ESLint with TypeScript support
